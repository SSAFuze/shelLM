# Ethical Considerations

Our implementation was evaluated by asking Linux users with various levels of security expertise to try our SSH honeypot and to identify which outputs helped them discern whether the system was a honeypot. Users were asked for consent to participate in the experiments. No personal data was retained after the answers were processed.
